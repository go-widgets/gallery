// Package webcanvas is the gallery's shared browser harness: the generic
// glue that blits a toolkit RGBA framebuffer into a <canvas> and routes DOM
// pointer / keyboard events into a widget scene. It carries no widget logic
// of its own — every demo in this module (the widget gallery, the isometric
// diagram editor, …) implements the small [App] interface and hands it to
// [Run], so the DOM plumbing lives in exactly one place instead of being
// copy-pasted per demo.
//
// The interface is defined here, in a tag-less file, so a native (non-wasm)
// build and its tests can name the type and assert that a scene satisfies it;
// the DOM implementation of [Run] lives in run_js.go behind a `js && wasm`
// build tag, so it drops out of the native build entirely.

// App is a self-contained canvas scene. A host (the wasm [Run] loop, or a

// widgets. Every coordinate is in canvas-local pixels (top-left origin), the
// same space [Run] derives from the pointer event's position within the
// canvas' bounding rectangle.
//
// Each event method reports whether the scene changed and therefore needs a
// repaint, so the host can skip a redraw when nothing moved. Draw is expected
// to fully paint the buffer (it is never given a dirty region).
type App interface {

	// Move delivers a pointer move at (x, y). While a Click gesture is in
	// flight it is a drag tick; otherwise it is a hover.
	Move(x, y int) bool

	// Release delivers the primary button release at (x, y), committing any
	// in-flight gesture Click began.
	Release(x, y int) bool

	// Context delivers a secondary (right) button press at (x, y), typically
	// opening a context menu. The host suppresses the browser's own menu.
	Context(x, y int) bool

	// Char delivers a single printable character typed with no Ctrl/Meta/Alt

// Ticker is an optional companion to [App]: a scene that needs a steady
// animation clock (a toast countdown, a blinking caret) implements it, and

// Animator is an optional companion to [App]: a scene with time-varying content
// driven by a REAL wall clock (procedurally animated icons, say) implements it,
// and [Run] installs a requestAnimationFrame loop that hands it the elapsed dt
// between frames — in seconds — through AnimationStep. Unlike [Ticker] (a fixed
// cadence that always repaints), an Animator advances by the true frame delta and
// reports whether the frame changed anything, so Run repaints only when a pixel
// actually moved. A scene that implements neither installs no clock and repaints
// on input alone. The phase-advance logic lives in the scene (natively testable);
// only the rAF wiring is browser-side.

// Resizer is an optional companion to [App]: a scene that can adapt its layout to

// and framebuffer, calls Resize, and repaints. A scene that omits it keeps the
// fixed [App.Size] forever — the pre-resize behaviour every existing demo relies
// on — so Run never installs the listener and the surface never changes.
//
// Resize is handed the target pixel size (the canvas' laid-out client box) and
// returns the size it will actually render at: a scene may clamp to a sane
// minimum, and the host allocates the framebuffer from the RETURNED size, so the
// scene and the buffer can never disagree. The relayout logic lives in the scene
// (natively testable); only the DOM resize wiring is browser-side.

// Scroller is an optional companion to [App]: a scene with a scrollable region
// (a docked list, an icon palette, an overflowing panel) implements it, and [Run]
// installs a "wheel" listener that translates the browser's WheelEvent into
// toolkit scroll ROWS and routes them — with the canvas-local pointer position, so
// the scene can hit-test which region the wheel is over — through Scroll. A scene
// that omits it installs no wheel listener, so the page keeps its default wheel
// behaviour and every existing demo (the widget gallery) is unchanged.
//
// dx / dy are the horizontal / vertical scroll amounts in toolkit ROWS (already
// normalised from the event's deltaMode by [scrollRows]): positive dy scrolls
// down / forward, positive dx scrolls right. A scene typically forwards them to
// the widget under (x, y) as a [toolkit.Event] of kind EventScroll (Delta = dy,
// DeltaX = dx), which scrollable widgets clamp at both ends. Scroll reports
// whether the scene changed and therefore needs a repaint.

// A browser WheelEvent reports its delta in one of three units, named by its

// delta (mode 1) passes straight through; a page delta (mode 2) is multiplied out.
